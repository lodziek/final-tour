In this project, I created a responsive travel website to promote the beauty of Bejaia.

I used Five parts ( Home, Places, Videos, About Us and Contact Us) where each one is integrated in a navigation bar.

In the Navigation section, every section of the website is linked. At the top left, you'll find the Logo and at the top

right the dark mode button.

In the Home section, a photo gallery shows the main offers and all of this are linked to the next section.

In the Places section, a grid of cards mentions the places that you want visit.

In the videos section, an aerial view makes the visitors another point of view of the region to visit.

In the About Us section, a summerised presentation is made.

In the Contact Us section, every visitor can get in touch with the travel agency.
